# Genetics

Inheritance and variation.

## Overview

Genetics studies how traits are inherited from parents to offspring and how genetic information is stored and expressed.

## Core Topics

### Mendelian Genetics
- Laws of inheritance
- Dominant and recessive alleles
- Punnett squares
- Dihybrid crosses

### Chromosomes
- Chromosome structure
- Karyotypes
- Sex chromosomes
- Chromosomal abnormalities

### Molecular Genetics
- DNA structure
- DNA replication
- Transcription
- Translation

### Gene Regulation
- Operons
- Transcription factors
- Epigenetics
- Non-coding RNA

### Mutations
- Types of mutations
- Causes of mutations
- Repair mechanisms
- Genetic disorders

### Population Genetics
- Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
- Allele frequencies
- Genetic drift
- Natural selection

### Biotechnology
- Recombinant DNA
- PCR
- Gene cloning
- CRISPR-Cas9

### Genomics
- Genome sequencing
- Comparative genomics
- Functional genomics
- Personalized medicine

## Applications

- Genetic testing
- Gene therapy
- Forensics
- Agriculture
