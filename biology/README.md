# Biology 🧬

The study of life and living organisms.

## Overview

Biology explores life at every scale, from molecules to ecosystems. Topics are organized from molecular to systems level.

- Cell structure and organelles
- Cell membrane and transport
- Cell cycle and division
- Cellular signaling

### [02-Genetics](./02-genetics/)
Inheritance and variation.
- Mendelian genetics
- Molecular genetics
- Population genetics
- Epigenetics

### [03-Molecular Biology](./03-molecular-biology/)
Life at the molecular level.
- DNA replication
- Transcription and translation
- Gene regulation
- Genetic engineering

### [04-Evolution](./04-evolution/)
Change over time.
- Natural selection
- Speciation
- Phylogenetics
- Evolutionary developmental biology

### [05-Ecology](./05-ecology/)
Organisms and their environment.
- Population ecology
