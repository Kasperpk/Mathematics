- Primary productivity
- Decomposition

### Behavioral Ecology
- Optimal foraging
- Mate choice
- Kin selection
- Altruism

### Landscape Ecology
- Habitat fragmentation
- Connectivity
- Edge effects
- Metapopulations

### Biogeography
- Species distributions
- Island biogeography
- Climate and biomes
- Historical biogeography

### Conservation Biology
- Biodiversity
- Endangered species
- Habitat loss
- Conservation strategies

### Global Ecology
- Climate change
- Biogeochemical cycles
- Human impacts

## Applications
