# Cell Biology

The fundamental unit of life.

## Overview

Cell biology studies the structure, function, and behavior of cells—the basic building blocks of all living organisms.

## Core Topics

### Cell Structure
- Prokaryotic vs eukaryotic cells
- Cell membrane
- Organelles
- Cytoskeleton

### Organelles
- Nucleus
- Mitochondria
- Endoplasmic reticulum
- Golgi apparatus
- Lysosomes and peroxisomes
- Chloroplasts (plants)

### Cell Membrane
- Fluid mosaic model
- Membrane proteins
- Transport mechanisms
- Signal transduction

### Cell Cycle
- Interphase (G1, S, G2)
- Mitosis
- Cytokinesis
- Cell cycle regulation

### Cell Division
- Mitosis
- Meiosis
- Checkpoints
- Cancer and cell cycle

### Cellular Communication
- Signaling pathways
- Receptors
- Second messengers
- Cell junctions

### Cell Death
- Apoptosis
- Necrosis
- Autophagy

## Techniques

- Microscopy
- Cell culture
- Flow cytometry
- Immunofluorescence
