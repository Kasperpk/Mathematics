- tRNA and amino acids
- Genetic code
- Regulation of translation

### Gene Regulation
- Prokaryotic regulation
- Eukaryotic regulation
- Chromatin remodeling
- Epigenetics

### RNA World
- Types of RNA
- RNAi and miRNA
- Non-coding RNAs
- Ribozymes

### Protein Structure and Function
- Protein folding
- Chaperones
- Post-translational modifications
- Protein degradation

### Techniques
- PCR and RT-PCR
