# Scientific Playground 🔬🧪🧬🔭

Welcome to my personal scientific playground - a comprehensive repository for exploring and mastering the fundamental sciences.

## 🎯 Mission

To build a deep, interconnected understanding of the natural sciences and mathematics, progressing from foundational principles to advanced concepts.

## 📚 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by scientific discipline, with each area structured to build knowledge progressively from fundamental concepts to advanced topics.

### [Mathematics](./mathematics/)
The language of science. Starting from set theory and logic, building through algebra and analysis, to applied mathematical methods.

### [Physics](./physics/)
Understanding the fundamental laws governing the universe, from classical mechanics to quantum theory and beyond.

### [Chemistry](./chemistry/)
Exploring the composition, structure, and transformation of matter at the atomic and molecular level.

### [Biology](./biology/)
Studying life from cellular processes to ecosystems, including genetics, evolution, and neuroscience.

## 🗺️ Learning Path

The recommended approach is to:
1. **Start with Mathematics** - especially set theory, logic, and proof techniques
2. **Build foundational Physics** - classical mechanics and thermodynamics
3. **Explore Chemistry** - atomic structure and chemical bonding
4. **Dive into Biology** - cellular biology and genetics

Each discipline reinforces the others, creating a web of interconnected knowledge.
