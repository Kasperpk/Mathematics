- Amines
- Aromatic compounds

### Stereochemistry
- Chirality
- Enantiomers and diastereomers
- R/S configuration
- Optical activity

### Reaction Mechanisms
- Nucleophilic substitution (SN1, SN2)
- Elimination (E1, E2)
- Addition reactions
- Radical reactions
- Oxidation and reduction

### Synthesis
- Retrosynthetic analysis
- Functional group interconversions
- Carbon-carbon bond formation
- Protecting groups

### Spectroscopy
- NMR (¹H and ¹³C)
