# Stoichiometry

Quantitative relationships in chemistry.

## Overview

Stoichiometry deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions.

## Core Topics

### The Mole Concept
- Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³)
- Molar mass
- Moles ↔ mass ↔ particles conversions

### Chemical Formulas
- Empirical formula
- Molecular formula
- Percent composition

### Balancing Equations
- Conservation of mass
- Coefficients
- Systematic approach

### Reaction Calculations
- Mole ratios
- Mass-to-mass calculations
- Limiting reagents
- Excess reagents
- Theoretical yield
- Percent yield

### Solution Stoichiometry
- Molarity
- Dilution
- Titration calculations

### Gas Stoichiometry
- Molar volume at STP
- Ideal gas law applications
- Dalton's law
