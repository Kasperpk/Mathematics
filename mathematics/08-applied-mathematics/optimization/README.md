# Optimization

Finding the best solutions to problems.

## Overview

Optimization theory provides methods for finding maximum or minimum values of functions, subject to constraints.

## Core Topics

- Quasi-Newton methods
- Conjugate gradient

### Constrained Optimization
- Lagrange multipliers
- KKT conditions
- Penalty methods
- Barrier methods

### Linear Programming
- Simplex method
- Duality theory
- Interior point methods
- Network optimization

### Convex Optimization
- Convex sets and functions
- Duality
- Semidefinite programming
- Second-order cone programming

### Discrete Optimization
- Integer programming
- Combinatorial optimization
- Dynamic programming
- Branch and bound

### Global Optimization
- Simulated annealing
- Genetic algorithms
- Particle swarm optimization

## Applications

- Machine learning (loss minimization)
- Operations research
- Portfolio optimization
- Control systems
- Engineering design
