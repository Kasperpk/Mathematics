# Abstract Algebra

The study of algebraic structures.

## Overview

Abstract algebra studies sets equipped with operations satisfying certain axioms. These structures appear throughout mathematics and physics.

## Core Structures

### Groups
A set G with operation • satisfying:
- Closure: a • b ∈ G
- Associativity: (a • b) • c = a • (b • c)
- Identity: ∃e: e • a = a • e = a
- Inverse: ∀a ∃a⁻¹: a • a⁻¹ = e

**Examples**: Integers under addition, invertible matrices, symmetry groups

### Rings
A set R with operations + and × satisfying:
- (R, +) is an abelian group
- Multiplication is associative
- Distributive laws hold

**Examples**: Integers ℤ, polynomials, matrices

### Fields
A ring where non-zero elements form a group under multiplication.

**Examples**: ℚ, ℝ, ℂ, finite fields 𝔽ₚ

### Vector Spaces and Modules
Generalizations of vector spaces over rings.
