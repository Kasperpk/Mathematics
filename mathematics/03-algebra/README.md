# Algebra

The study of mathematical structures and operations.

## Overview

Algebra explores abstract structures like groups, rings, and fields, as well as concrete tools like matrices and linear transformations.

## Sections

### [Abstract Algebra](./abstract-algebra/)
Algebraic structures and their properties.
- Groups
- Rings
- Fields
- Modules

### [Linear Algebra](./linear-algebra/)
Vectors, matrices, and linear transformations.
- Vector spaces
- Linear transformations
- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Inner product spaces

## Learning Path

1. Start with linear algebra for practical applications
2. Move to abstract algebra for deeper understanding
3. See connections between the two areas

## Prerequisites

- Set theory
- Logic and proof techniques
- Basic arithmetic operations
