# Topology

The study of properties preserved under continuous deformations.

## Overview

Topology studies properties that remain unchanged when objects are stretched, bent, or twisted (but not torn or glued). It's often called "rubber sheet geometry."

## Core Topics

### Point-Set Topology
- Topological spaces
- Open and closed sets
- Continuity
- Compactness
- Connectedness
- Separation axioms

### Algebraic Topology
- Fundamental group
- Covering spaces
- Homology
- Cohomology
- Homotopy

### Manifolds
- Topological manifolds
- Smooth manifolds
- Classification of surfaces
- Higher-dimensional manifolds

### Key Examples
- Möbius strip
- Klein bottle
- Torus
- Projective plane
- Spheres in various dimensions

## Important Theorems

- Brouwer fixed-point theorem
- Borsuk-Ulam theorem
- Ham sandwich theorem
- Euler characteristic
- Poincaré duality

## Applications

- Physics (topological phases of matter)
- Data analysis (topological data analysis)
- Robotics (configuration spaces)
- Network theory

## Prerequisites

- Real analysis
- Abstract algebra (for algebraic topology)
- Linear algebra

## Resources

- "Topology" by Munkres
- "Algebraic Topology" by Hatcher (free online)
