# Analysis

The rigorous study of limits, continuity, and change.

## Overview

Analysis provides the rigorous foundation for calculus and extends these ideas to more abstract settings.

## Sections

### [Calculus](./calculus/)
The computational side of analysis.
- Differentiation
- Integration
- Multivariable calculus
- Vector calculus

### [Real Analysis](./real-analysis/)
Rigorous foundations of calculus.
- Construction of real numbers
- Sequences and series
- Continuity and differentiability
- Measure theory

### [Complex Analysis](./complex-analysis/)
Analysis of functions of complex variables.
- Complex differentiation
- Contour integration
- Residue theorem
- Conformal mappings

## Learning Path

1. Master calculus computationally first
2. Study real analysis for rigorous foundations
3. Explore complex analysis for powerful tools

## Prerequisites

- Strong foundation in algebra
