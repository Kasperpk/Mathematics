# Calculus

The mathematics of change.

## Overview

Calculus provides the tools to analyze and compute rates of change, areas, and accumulation.

## Core Topics

### Limits
- Intuitive understanding
- Epsilon-delta definition
- Limit laws
- L'Hôpital's rule

### Differentiation
- Definition as a limit
- Derivative rules (power, product, quotient, chain)
- Implicit differentiation
- Applications: optimization, related rates

### Integration
- Definite and indefinite integrals
- Fundamental theorem of calculus
- Integration techniques
- Applications: areas, volumes, work

### Sequences and Series
- Convergence tests
- Power series
- Taylor series
- Applications in approximation

### Multivariable Calculus
- Partial derivatives
- Gradient, divergence, curl
- Multiple integrals
- Change of variables

### Vector Calculus
- Line integrals
- Surface integrals
- Green's, Stokes', and Divergence theorems

## Applications

- Physics (motion, electromagnetism)
- Engineering (optimization, control systems)
- Economics (marginal analysis)
- Biology (population dynamics)
