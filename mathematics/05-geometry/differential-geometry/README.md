# Differential Geometry

Geometry using the tools of calculus.

## Overview

Differential geometry studies curves, surfaces, and higher-dimensional manifolds using differentiation. It's essential for modern physics.

## Core Topics

### Curves
- Parametric curves
- Arc length
- Curvature and torsion
- Frenet-Serret formulas

### Surfaces
- Parametric surfaces
- First fundamental form
- Second fundamental form
- Gaussian curvature

### Riemannian Geometry
- Metrics and tensors
- Geodesics
- Curvature tensors
- Riemannian manifolds

### Manifolds
- Topological manifolds
- Smooth manifolds
- Tangent spaces
- Differential forms

### Connections
- Covariant derivative
- Parallel transport
- Levi-Civita connection
- Holonomy

## Applications

- General relativity
- Gauge theory
- String theory
- Computer graphics
- Robotics

## Prerequisites

- Multivariable calculus
- Linear algebra
- Real analysis
- Topology (helpful)
