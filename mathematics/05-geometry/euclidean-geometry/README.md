# Euclidean Geometry

Classical geometry in flat space.

## Overview

Euclidean geometry is the study of flat space based on Euclid's axioms. It forms the foundation for understanding more advanced geometries.

## Core Topics

### Axioms and Foundations
- Euclid's five postulates
- Hilbert's axioms
- Non-Euclidean geometries

### Basic Figures
- Points, lines, planes
- Angles and their measures
- Triangles (congruence, similarity)
- Circles

### Constructions
- Compass and straightedge
- Classic construction problems
- Impossible constructions

### Transformations
- Translations
- Rotations
- Reflections
- Dilations

### Coordinate Geometry
- Cartesian coordinates
- Distance and midpoint
- Equations of lines and circles
- Conic sections
