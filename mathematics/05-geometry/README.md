# Geometry

The study of shapes, spaces, and their properties.

## Overview

Geometry explores the properties of space, from classical Euclidean geometry to modern differential and algebraic approaches.

## Sections

### [Euclidean Geometry](./euclidean-geometry/)
Classical geometry in flat space.
- Axioms and postulates

- Transformations

### [Differential Geometry](./differential-geometry/)
Geometry using calculus.
- Curves and surfaces
- Curvature
- Riemannian geometry
- Applications in physics

## Prerequisites

- Linear algebra
- Multivariable calculus (for differential geometry)
- Group theory (for symmetry)
