# Mathematical Foundations 🏛️

The bedrock of all mathematical thinking.

## Overview

These foundational topics form the basis upon which all other mathematics is built. Master these first before moving to other areas.

## Topics

### [Set Theory](./set-theory/)
The study of collections of objects.
- Basic set operations (union, intersection, complement)
- Venn diagrams
- Cardinality and infinite sets
- Axiom of Choice and Zorn's Lemma

### [Logic](./logic/)
The principles of valid reasoning.
- Propositional logic
- Predicate logic
- Logical connectives
- Quantifiers

### [Proof Techniques](./proof-techniques/)
Methods for establishing mathematical truth.
- Direct proof
- Proof by contradiction
- Mathematical induction
- Proof by contrapositive

## Learning Order

1. Start with basic set theory concepts
2. Learn propositional and predicate logic
3. Master proof techniques by practicing extensively

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Importance |
|---------|------------|
| Sets and subsets | Foundation for all mathematical structures |
| Logical operators | Building blocks of formal reasoning |
| Implications | Understanding when statements follow from others |
| Quantifiers | Expressing "for all" and "there exists" |
| Proof structure | Constructing rigorous arguments |
