# Set Theory

The mathematical study of collections.

## Core Concepts

### Basic Definitions
- **Set**: A collection of distinct objects
- **Element**: An object belonging to a set (∈)
- **Empty set**: The set with no elements (∅)
- **Subset**: A ⊆ B means every element of A is in B

### Set Operations
- **Union**: A ∪ B = {x : x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
- **Intersection**: A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
- **Complement**: A' = {x : x ∉ A}
- **Difference**: A \ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B}
- **Cartesian Product**: A × B = {(a,b) : a ∈ A and b ∈ B}

### Special Sets
- **ℕ**: Natural numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
- **ℤ**: Integers {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
- **ℚ**: Rational numbers
- **ℝ**: Real numbers
- **ℂ**: Complex numbers

### Cardinality
- **Finite sets**: |A| = n for some natural number n
- **Countably infinite**: Same cardinality as ℕ (ℵ₀)
- **Uncountably infinite**: Larger than ℕ (e.g., ℝ)

### Relations and Functions
- **Relation**: Subset of A × B
- **Function**: A relation where each input has exactly one output
- **Injection**: One-to-one function
- **Surjection**: Onto function
- **Bijection**: Both injective and surjective

## Practice Problems

1. Prove that A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
2. Show that |ℕ| = |ℤ|
3. Prove that ℝ is uncountable (Cantor's diagonal argument)
