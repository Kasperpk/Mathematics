# Probability and Statistics

The mathematics of uncertainty and data analysis.

## Overview

Probability theory quantifies uncertainty, while statistics uses data to make inferences about the world.

## Core Topics

- Continuous distributions
- Expectation and variance
- Moment generating functions
- Common distributions (binomial, Poisson, normal, etc.)

### Limit Theorems
- Law of large numbers
- Central limit theorem
- Convergence concepts

### Stochastic Processes
- Random walks
- Markov chains
- Poisson processes
- Brownian motion

### Statistical Inference
- Point estimation
