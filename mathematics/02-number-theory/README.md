# Number Theory

The study of integers and their properties.

## Overview

Number theory explores the fundamental properties of numbers, particularly integers. It has deep connections to algebra and applications in cryptography.

## Core Topics

### Divisibility
- Division algorithm
- Greatest common divisor (GCD)
- Euclidean algorithm
- Least common multiple (LCM)

### Prime Numbers
- Fundamental theorem of arithmetic
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Prime number theorem
- Primality testing

### Modular Arithmetic
- Congruence relations
- Modular operations
- Chinese Remainder Theorem
- Fermat's Little Theorem
- Euler's theorem

### Diophantine Equations
- Linear Diophantine equations
- Pythagorean triples
- Fermat's Last Theorem

### Number-Theoretic Functions
- Euler's totient function φ(n)
- Möbius function μ(n)
- Divisor function σ(n)

## Applications
