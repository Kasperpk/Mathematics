# General Relativity

Gravity as spacetime curvature.

## Overview

General relativity is Einstein's theory of gravitation, describing gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.

## Core Concepts

### Equivalence Principle
- Inertial and gravitational mass are equivalent
- Gravity is locally indistinguishable from acceleration

### Mathematical Framework
- Differential geometry
- Tensors
- Metric tensor
- Christoffel symbols
- Riemann curvature tensor

### Einstein Field Equations
```
Gμν + Λgμν = (8πG/c⁴)Tμν
```
- Relates spacetime geometry (left side) to matter/energy (right side)
- Gμν: Einstein tensor
- Λ: Cosmological constant
- gμν: Metric tensor
- Tμν: Stress-energy tensor

### Solutions
- Schwarzschild (non-rotating black hole)
- Kerr (rotating black hole)
- Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (cosmology)

### Black Holes
- Event horizon
- Singularities
- Hawking radiation
- Information paradox

### Gravitational Waves
- Ripples in spacetime
- Detection (LIGO/Virgo)
- Sources (merging black holes, neutron stars)

### Cosmology
- Expanding universe
- Big Bang
- Dark matter and dark energy

## Applications

- GPS corrections
- Gravitational lensing
- Cosmological models
