# Special Relativity

Physics at near-light speeds.

## Overview

Special relativity describes how space and time behave when objects move at speeds approaching the speed of light.

## Core Concepts

### Postulates
1. Laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames
2. Speed of light is constant in all inertial frames

### Lorentz Transformations
- Time dilation: t' = γt
- Length contraction: L' = L/γ
- Relativity of simultaneity

### Spacetime
- Minkowski metric
- Light cones
- Worldlines
- Proper time

### Relativistic Mechanics
- Four-vectors
- Relativistic momentum: p = γmv
- Energy-mass equivalence: E = mc²
- Four-momentum

### Relativistic Electromagnetism
- Electromagnetic field tensor
- Transformation of fields
- Covariant formulation

## Key Results

- Nothing can travel faster than light
- Mass and energy are equivalent
- Time is relative
