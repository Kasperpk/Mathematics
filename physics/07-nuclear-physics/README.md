# Nuclear Physics

Atomic nuclei and nuclear processes.

## Overview

Nuclear physics studies the structure and behavior of atomic nuclei, including radioactive decay and nuclear reactions.

## Core Topics

### Nuclear Structure
- Nuclear constituents (protons, neutrons)
- Nuclear forces
- Binding energy
- Nuclear models (shell, liquid drop)

### Radioactivity

- Beta decay
- Gamma decay
- Half-life and decay chains

### Nuclear Reactions
- Conservation laws
- Cross sections
- Fission
- Fusion

### Nuclear Models
- Liquid drop model
- Shell model
- Collective models

### Applications
- Nuclear power
- Nuclear weapons
- Medical imaging (PET, SPECT)
- Radiation therapy
- Radiocarbon dating
