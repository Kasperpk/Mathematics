# Thermodynamics

Heat, energy, and entropy.

## Overview

Thermodynamics studies energy transformations and the relationships between heat, work, and the properties of matter.

## Core Topics

### Laws of Thermodynamics
- Zeroth law (thermal equilibrium)
- First law (conservation of energy)
- Second law (entropy)
- Third law (absolute zero)

### Thermodynamic Properties
- Temperature
- Pressure
- Volume
- Internal energy
- Enthalpy
- Entropy
- Free energies

### Thermodynamic Processes
- Isothermal
- Adiabatic
- Isobaric
- Isochoric
- Reversible and irreversible

### Heat Engines and Refrigerators
- Carnot cycle
- Efficiency
- Heat pumps

### Statistical Mechanics
- Microstates and macrostates
- Boltzmann distribution
- Partition functions
- Ensembles

### Phase Transitions
- Phase diagrams
- Critical points
- First and second order transitions

## Applications

- Heat engines
- Refrigeration
- Chemical reactions
- Biological systems
